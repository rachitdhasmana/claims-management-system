### 1. Introduction

This test plan outlines the approach to testing the Claims Management System, focusing on role-based access control (RBAC) and claim operations. The system includes general users and admin users, with different access and capabilities for managing claims.

### 2. Test Objectives

- Validate user authentication and authorization.
- Ensure role-based access control is implemented correctly.
- Verify CRUD operations on claims based on user roles.
- Check data integrity and security.

### 3. Test Scope

The testing will cover:
- User registration and login.
- Role-based access to claim operations (view, create, update, delete).
- Data validation and error handling.

### 4. Assumptions

- The system is already deployed in a test environment.
- Test data will be prepared before test execution.
- All dependencies (e.g., database, external services) are available and stable.

### 5. Test Environment

- Operating System: Windows/Linux
- Browser: Chrome, Firefox, Edge
- Backend: Flask
- Database: In-memory database
- Tools: Postman, Swagger UI, unittest module

### 6. Test Cases

#### User Authentication and Authorization

**Test Case 1: User Registration**
- **Objective**: Ensure users can register with valid credentials.
- **Steps**:
  1. Send a POST request to `/register` with valid user data.
  2. Verify the response status is 201.
  3. Check the response message for success.
- **Expected Result**: User is registered successfully.

**Test Case 2: User Login**
- **Objective**: Ensure users can log in with valid credentials.
- **Steps**:
  1. Send a POST request to `/login` with valid user credentials.
  2. Verify the response status is 200.
  3. Check the response for a valid JWT token.
- **Expected Result**: User logs in successfully and receives a JWT token.

#### Claim Management for General Users

**Test Case 3: General User Creates Claim**
- **Objective**: Ensure general users can create a claim.
- **Steps**:
  1. Log in as a general user.
  2. Send a POST request to `/api/claims` with valid claim data.
  3. Verify the response status is 201.
  4. Check the created claim details.
- **Expected Result**: Claim is created successfully.

**Test Case 4: General User Views Own Claims**
- **Objective**: Ensure general users can view their own claims.
- **Steps**:
  1. Log in as a general user.
  2. Send a GET request to `/api/claims`.
  3. Verify the response status is 200.
  4. Check that the claims belong to the logged-in user.
- **Expected Result**: Only the user's own claims are listed.

**Test Case 5: General User Deletes Own Claim**
- **Objective**: Ensure general users can delete their own claims.
- **Steps**:
  1. Log in as a general user.
  2. Send a DELETE request to `/api/claims/{claim_id}`.
  3. Verify the response status is 200.
  4. Check that the claim is deleted.
- **Expected Result**: Claim is deleted successfully.

**Test Case 6: General User Cannot Update Claim Status**
- **Objective**: Ensure general users cannot update the claim status.
- **Steps**:
  1. Log in as a general user.
  2. Send a PUT request to `/api/claims/{claim_id}` to update the status.
  3. Verify the response status is 403 or an appropriate error message.
- **Expected Result**: User receives a forbidden error.

#### Claim Management for Admin Users

**Test Case 7: Admin Views All Claims**
- **Objective**: Ensure admin users can view all claims.
- **Steps**:
  1. Log in as an admin user.
  2. Send a GET request to `/api/claims`.
  3. Verify the response status is 200.
  4. Check that all claims are listed.
- **Expected Result**: All claims are listed.

**Test Case 8: Admin Updates Claim Status**
- **Objective**: Ensure admin users can update the status of any claim.
- **Steps**:
  1. Log in as an admin user.
  2. Send a PUT request to `/api/claims/{claim_id}` to update the status.
  3. Verify the response status is 200.
  4. Check the updated claim details.
- **Expected Result**: Claim status is updated successfully.

**Test Case 9: Admin Deletes Any Claim**
- **Objective**: Ensure admin users can delete any claim.
- **Steps**:
  1. Log in as an admin user.
  2. Send a DELETE request to `/api/claims/{claim_id}`.
  3. Verify the response status is 200.
  4. Check that the claim is deleted.
- **Expected Result**: Claim is deleted successfully.

### 7. Test Data

- **Users**:
  - General User: `{"username": "user1", "password": "password1", "role": "user"}`
  - Admin User: `{"username": "admin1", "password": "password1", "role": "admin"}`

- **Claims**:
  - Claim 1: `{"type": "type 1", "value": 100, "attachment": "link_to_file"}`
  - Claim 2: `{"type": "type 2", "value": 200, "attachment": "link_to_file"}`

### 8. Test Execution

- Tests will be executed using Postman for API requests.
- Automated tests will be run using the unittest module.
- Each test case will be marked as pass or fail based on the expected outcome.

### 9. Test Reporting

- Test results will be documented and shared with the development team.
- Any defects found will be logged with detailed steps to reproduce.

### 10. Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk**: JWT tokens may expire during testing.
  - **Mitigation**: Ensure to generate a new token if the current one expires.
- **Risk**: Inconsistent test environment setup.
  - **Mitigation**: Use a stable test environment and reset the database before tests.
