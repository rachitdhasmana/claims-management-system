### Claims Management System Project Plan and Roadmap

#### Overview

This project involves developing a Claims Management System with a Flask backend, in-memory database, and Swagger UI for API documentation. The system will support CRUD operations for claims with additional features like file attachments and status updates.

#### Design and Architecture

1. **Backend**: Flask for the API, SQLAlchemy for ORM, and SQLite for in-memory database.
2. **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the UI.
3. **API Documentation**: Swagger UI.
4. **Containerization**: Docker for containerization.
5. **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery.

#### Risk Analysis

1. **Technical Risks**:
    - In-memory database limitations: Mitigation by planning for transition to a persistent database.
    - Dependency vulnerabilities: Regular updates and monitoring.
    - Scaling and availability issues: Plan for cloud deployment (AWS, Azure).
    - Django over Flask as backend: Mitigation by updating to django if the scale of application goes beyond basic CRUD operations

2. **Operational Risks**:
    - Downtime during upgrades: Use blue-green deployment strategies.
    - Data loss: Implement backup strategies.

3. **Security Risks**:
    - Data breaches: Implement strong authentication mechanisms and encrypt sensitive data.
    - Sensitive data: if the User of Claim data models are updated to include PII data, ensure data masking.
    - Unauthorized access: Role-based access control.
   
4. **Project Management Risks**:
    - Planned Leaves: Keeping a shadow resource ready with regular knowledge sharing and showcase sessions.
    - Attrition: Keeping project state consistent with steady handovers and knowledge transfers.
    - Priority updates: Keeping stakeholders informed, recording decisions and updating project plan/roadmap regularly.

#### Tech Stack

1. **Backend**: Flask, SQLAlchemy, SQLite (initially).
2. **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
3. **API Documentation**: Swagger UI.
4. **Containerization**: Docker.
5. **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions.
6. **Possible Future Enhancements**: React/Vue.js for frontend, PostgreSQL/MySQL for database, Redis for caching, OAuth2 for authentication.

#### Frameworks Upgrades

- **Flask**: Monitor for new releases and upgrade to latest stable versions.
- **SQLAlchemy**: Regularly update to benefit from performance improvements and new features.
- **Swagger UI**: Ensure the latest version is used for better functionality and security.
- **Docker**: Keep the Docker base image updated for security patches.

#### Continuous Improvements

- Regularly refactor code to improve readability and maintainability.
- Monitor performance metrics and optimize where necessary.
- Keep dependencies up-to-date to avoid security vulnerabilities.
- Continuously improve the user interface for a better user experience.

This project plan provides a structured approach to developing, enhancing, and maintaining the Claims Management System, ensuring it is scalable, secure, and efficient.
